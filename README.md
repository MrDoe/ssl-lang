# SSL-lang Extension

This extension "ssl-lang" is an unofficial syntax highlighting support for the Starlims Scripting Language.

## Features 

For now, the extension just provides the 'SSL' language and basic syntax highlighting via the text mate grammar.

Basic code snippets may be added soon, while sophisticated language support via LSP is required to be added by other extensions.
